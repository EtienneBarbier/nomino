# Nomino
The goal of Nomino is to generate words based on number of syllables.  
This tool is a remake of an old tool which no longer exists `Nomino` developed by `Carrapide Tech`.

## Operations
Words are generated by generate many syllables.
Syllables are generated following dictionary file.
This file described which letter or group of letter you want to see in syllable.
Letters (and groups) are sorted by type, vowel or consonant and each entry have weight for the draw.  
As is, we can try to imitate a specific language as English, French or another one.
